## About me

I'm a developer with 6 years of experience in commercial and open-source development. I've worked on a variety of projects, starting from APCS and embedded systems to web services and SaaS platforms. I also make funny things like this [satirical programming language](https://github.com/fresh-milkshake/gov).
