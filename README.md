## About me

Hey there! I'm a developer with 6 years of experience in both commercial and open-source shenanigans. My coding journey has taken me everywhere - from wrangling APCS and embedded systems to conjuring up web services and SaaS platforms. Occasionally, I even make silly things like this [satirical programming language](https://github.com/fresh-milkshake/gov) (because why not?).
